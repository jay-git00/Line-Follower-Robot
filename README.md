# Line-Follower-Robot

Designed and built a line following robot by modeling all mechanical components in Fusion 360 and fabricated
using a combination of 3D printing and laser cutting.

– Worked on Arduino, IR sensors and motors to achieve smooth and reliable line following.

– Aimed to build a self-balancing bike using a reaction wheel mechanism and advanced motor control but shifted
approach due to design and hardware constraints.
